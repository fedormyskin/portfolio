-	president of [IGEL](https://igelsociety.org) (the International Society of the Empirical Study of Literature).

My research concerns computational literary studies, narrative theory, and the impact of digital technologies on literature, especially regarding digital social reading. 

In one sentence, I use computational, qualitative, and quantitative methods to study reader response.
