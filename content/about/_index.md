-	co-founder and member of the editorial board of [Enthymema](https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/enthymema/index), an Open Access international academic journal of theory, critics and philosophy of literature;
- managing editor of the journal [Scientific Study of Literature](https://ssol-journal.com);

-	member of the scientific advisory board of [OPERAS](https://www.operas-eu.org) (the Research Infrastructure supporting open scholarly communication in the social sciences and humanities in the European Research Area);
-	president of [IGEL](https://igelsociety.org) (the International Society of the Empirical Study of Literature).

My research concerns computational literary studies, narrative theory, and the impact of digital technologies on literature, especially regarding digital social reading. 

In one sentence, I use computational, qualitative, and quantitative methods to study reader response.
