[1]: /img/portfolio/1_tilburg.jpg

I conceptualised and designed the user experience of a virtual reality app for reading. I co-designed the experiment to test whether VR increases narrative absorption, empathy for the characters, and intention to read. It does, but the effect size is very small.

### Tools and skills

Aframe VR, HTML, Mozilla VR browser, SPSS 

Concept, user experience design, content curation, deployment, ANCOVA, MANCOVA, mediation analysis
