I prepared three digital resources for the social annotation of texts, to support online teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses in Italian Literature (University of Milan-Bicocca), Korean Studies, and Korean Literature (Sogang University). So far, I collected around 400 annotations done by 150 students, which we used for learning assessment and I will analyse to draw insight about the pedagogical use of digital social reading tools.
