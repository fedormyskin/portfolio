I conceptualised and designed the user experience of a virtual reality app for listening to audiobooks while immersed in an environment that enhances narrative absorption. I’ve also written the script to animate the camera according to the narrative progression. And I designed the experiment for a cross-cultural comparison of the user experience (presence and narrative absorption) of Italian and Korean users.
