Using online fanfiction stories (Archive of Our Own, AO3), we are testing the hypothesis — derived from cultural evolution theory — that cultural innovations are mostly recombinations of previously existing elements. We are using data from 10 years of publications on AO3 for a total of around 200,000 stories and more than 2 million tags describing characters, relationships, topics, and genre. This research illustrates the potential of the combination of cultural evolution theory and digital literary studies, and it paves the way for the study of the effects of online digital media on cultural cumulation.
