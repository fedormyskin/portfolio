Using online fanfiction stories (Archive of Our Own), we tested the hypothesis — derived from cultural evolution theory — that culture evolves by increasingly accumulating cultural traits that are received by other agents, and such accumulation leads to some kind of improvement of the overall cultural system. We focused on the number of characters, relationships, and themes in 200,000 _Harry Potter_ stories.
