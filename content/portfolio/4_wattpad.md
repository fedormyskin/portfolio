We presented an overview of the possibility offered by a digital social reading platform like Wattpad for the study of reader response. We used various quantitative methods to show the world distribution and language diversity of Wattpad stories (30 million titles) and readers. We also used sentiment analysis to detect the cognitive and emotional response to text paragraphs, and network analysis to understand how interactions between readers can affect reading comprehension and aesthetic appreciation. This study is an example of how “scalable reading” – the combination of close and distant reading – can be successfully employed for the study of literature.
