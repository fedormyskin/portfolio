The “Graphs and Ontologies for Literary Evolution Models” is a 5-year (2023-2027) research project funded by the European Commission (ERC StG).

The goal of the project is to create accurate models of how the (formal and content-related) cultural traits of fiction spread and combine. The data used are (fan)fiction stories in 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Korean, and Indonesian) gathered from various online platforms.

The methodology mainly combines computational literary studies and cultural evolution theory, with influences from fan studies and information science.

### Tools and skills
