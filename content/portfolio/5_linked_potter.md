![Schema of Harry Potter ontology][1]

[1]: /img/portfolio/5_linked-potter.jpg

Using user-generated tags extracted from fanfiction stories (Archive of Our Own), I created an ontology to categorise the various metadata used by authors. I also created a knowledge base by linking the ontology with all the 30,000 unique tags used in Harry Potter fanfiction stories.

### Tools and skills

R, Protégé, OWL, SPARQL 

Web scraping, ontology creation, linked data
