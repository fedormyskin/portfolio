I conceptualised and designed the user experience of a virtual reality app for listening to audiobooks while immersed in an environment that enhances narrative absorption. I directed the creation of five different VR spaces and selected the short stories and poems to be included in the version released in public libraries and a prison.

### Tools and skills

Concept, user experience design, content curation

### Outputs

Exhibited at the UNESCO Creative Cities meeting, Literature pavilion (Fabriano, Italy). Demo: https://youtu.be/VhZvV4n-oJM

Permanently available in Milan public libraries and in a prison (Italy).
